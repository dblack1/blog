    <p>
      For my third blog post, I will be writing about CSS animations. CSS
      animations can be used to change the styling of an element without using
      Javascript. With CSS animations, you can change any CSS property you want.
      Animations are commonly used for changing colors or making something grow
      or shrink, but they can do more complex things like make elements move
      across a page. To use CSS animations, you have to specify keyframes that
      determine what styles an element will have at certain times. Here is an
      example of a keyframe that will changes the color of the
      <code>h1</code> tag on this page:
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        @keyframes example {
          from { color: blue; }
          to { color: red; }
        }

        #h1-animation {
          color: red;
          animation-name: example;
          animation-duration: 4s;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      In this example, we set up a keyframe that will start the element's color
      at blue and end the element's color at red. Then in
      <code>#h1-animation</code>, we specify that we want the
      <code>example</code> keyframe to be applied by using the
      <code>animation-name</code> property. Finally, we say that the animation
      should take 4s to complete by using the
      <code>animation-duration</code> property. Here is a more complex
      animation:
    </p>

    <div id="box"></div>

    <p>The code for this animation is as follows:</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        @keyframes example2 {
          0% { background-color: red; left: 0%; }
          25% { background-color: yellow; left: 25%; }
          50% { background-color: blue; left: 50%; }
          75% { background-color: green; left: 75%; }
          100% { background-color: red; left: 100%; }
        }

        #box {
          width: 100px;
          height: 100px;
          background-color: red;
          position: relative;
          animation-name: example2;
          animation-duration: 4s;
          animation-iteration-count: infinite;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      In this example, we are more specific with the stages of the animation.
      Properties for the animation are set when the animation is 0% finished,
      25% finished, 50% finished, 75% finished, and 100% finished. This example
      uses background color as well as positioning to move the item. Finally,
      the animation does not stop because
      <code>animation-iteration-count</code> is set to infinite. If you only
      wanted the animation to run twice, you could set this property to 2.
