    <h1>Blog 2: Javascript Asynchronous Functions: Async and Await</h1>

    <p>
      For my second blog post, I decided to look into asynchronous programming
      in Javascript. I have used asynchronous functions in Javascript before,
      but I never completely understood what they did or how they worked.
      Javascript is a single-threaded programming language. This means that only
      one thing can happen at a time. This can make programming simple, but it
      also can create a problem if you are making a request to an API that takes
      a long time. Your webpage might be left unresponsive for a while because
      the main thread is being taken up by the API call. Asynchronous
      programming can help minimize this problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the easiest ways to use asynchronous programming in Javascript is
      by using <code>aysnc</code> and <code>await</code> in your functions. Here
      is an example of an async function in Javascript:
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        async function f() {
          return 1;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      Placing <code>async</code> in front of a function means that the function
      will always return a promise. It also means that you can use
      <code>await</code> inside of that function. <code>await</code> is another
      part of asynchronous programming that will make Javascript wait until a
      promise that is placed after <code>await</code> resolves. Here is an
      example using <code>await</code>:
    </p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        async function f() {

          let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
          });

          let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)

          alert(result); // "done!"
        }

        f();
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
      One of the main benefits of using <code>await</code> is that it allows the
      program to do other things while waiting for the promise to resolve. Some
      of these things could be like handling user input or running scripts.
      Using <code>async/await</code> would help us solve our inital problem.
