		<h1>Blog 1: HTML Best Practices</h1>

		<p>
			For my articles, I decided to investigate some best practices with HTML.
			A common theme that I found was to maintatin consistency within your code.
			Whether it be closing self closing tags or with your naming conventions, you should
			be consistent. Another common practice that I found was to not use inline CSS.
			Finally, I found a common best practice to be ensuring that your site is accessible
			to all users. This could be done using the <code>alt</code> tag or with the <code>aria</code>
			attribute.
		</p>

		<p>
			The articles that I read also metioned to ensure that you are using title and meta tags correctly for SEO optimization. 
			One interesting best practice that I found was to put your <code>script</code> elements at 
			the bottom of your file. This will allow the page to load faster because it will parse the HTML first
			and save the Javascript for last. Another method to do this would be to use the <code>defer</code> or
			<code>async</code> attribute. These can be implemented like this: 
		</p>

		<code> &lt;script async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
		<p> or </p>
		<code> &lt;script defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>

		<p>
			Using <code>async</code> will pause HTML during the script execution only and using <code>defer</code> will pause
			script execution until the HTML has finished parsing. Here are the links to the articles that I read:
